So I've been playing around with procedural generation for a while now and I
wanted to share my workflow.

I've been programming for ages now, and i was mainly C++ programmer. Lately I've
been moving to lower level/simpler (e.g. some call it C--) programming. This is
somewhat reflected in the software I'm using/developing. And all of that
experience and work is my project called "PixelDance".

It started as a "what if shadertoy but with more flexible pipeline". Now it grows
as I need something (e.g. want more performance, lets add [Transform feedback](https://open.gl/feedback)).

These are the guiding principles:
* Performance - many toys need huge computations thus GPU needs to help. I've chosen opengl.
* Easy to play with - there are things you want to change on the fly and see.
	That is why [DearImgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) is used for gui.
* Easy to reconfigure - some things need way different 'pipeline'. That is why i'm using
	very performant and easy to integrate [LuaJit](http://luajit.org/). The language itself
	is very simple and binding is easy (when you get used to the stack).
* Easy to hack - the C style C++ "engine" allows quick addition of various things
	I need.
* Edit and see - inspired by [Handmade hero](https://handmadehero.org/) and others
	(also called hot loading) the engine automatically reloads the script as soon
	as you save, thus change a value and see.
* OpenSource - I'm using [CC-BY: Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
	as I don't believe this is something benefits from being locked down.
* Save and remember - usually when saving an image I append the source to it so
	later I can load it and continue editing.

So I invite you to check it out [here](https://github.com/warmist/PixelDance).
